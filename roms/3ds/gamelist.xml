		<name>Brain Age: Concentration Training</name>
		<desc>Brain Age is back with all-new devilishly difficult brain-training exercises designed by world-famous brain researcher Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. The modern mind has numerous devices to stay connected (e.g. laptops, smart phones, tablets), and these distractions have led to an information overload making it difficult to stay focused on specific tasks. Brain Age: Concentration Training offers newly designed training exercises to combat this information addiction. By spending at least five minutes a day, these exercises will challenge players with activities to help improve their concentration skills and the ability to access their short term memory. The new Devilish Training exercises dynamically increase or decrease in difficulty based on your real-time results to help consistently train players at the limit of their abilities. Beyond the Devilish Training, there are additional new and classic puzzles for every purpose, whether to challenge one's concentration or math skills or provide relaxation activities to give the brain a break.</desc>

		<path>./Kirby - Planet Robobot (USA).3ds</path>
		<name>Kirby - Planet Robobot</name>
		<desc>Kirby: Planet Robobot is a 2.5D side-scrolling platform game that uses traditional Kirby platform gameplay; the aim of the game is to guide Kirby towards the end of the level while utilizing his copy abilities to defeat enemies and interact with the environment. This time around, Kirby is defending Popstar from the corrupt Haltmann Works Company, which aims to mechanize the planet and steal its natural resources. The new gameplay mechanic introduced in this title is Robobot Armor, a mech suit with copy abilities similar to Kirby's own. The Robobot Armor is much more powerful than Kirby and can interact with obstacles that he may not be able to pass on his own, but its large size sometimes means Kirby will need to exit the suit and proceed on foot. In addition to the mech gameplay, Kirby has access to three copy abilities that are new to the series: Doctor, Poison, and ESP. All copy abilities can be accessed at will by scanning in compatible amiibos, including alternate costumes that can only be obtained through figures made specifically for this game. 
 
Alternate modes include Team Kirby Clash, an action RPG that supports up to 4 players; Kirby 3D Rumble, in which Kirby moves around an arena to defeat enemies as fast as possible while aiming for a high score; Meta Knightmare Returns, a speed-oriented mode in which the player controls Meta Knight through modified versions of the levels from story mode; and the Arena and True Arena modes that return from other platformers in the series.</desc>

It has many returning features from the previous Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley, such as the ability to sculpt and shape the terrain on farmland, but unlike The Lost Valley, there is a fully fledged town that is usually available in most Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons games. To veterans of the series, all the familiar features are there as well; the ability to woo and marry from a myriad of potential marriage candidates, exploring the wilderness, and of course, the farming itself! The "Save the Harvest Goddess/Restore the Land" theme that is featured in many of the previous entries to the series returns as well, so farmers better grab their hoes and get back down to earth!  
 
Features 
 
    Build up your own farm from scratch 
    Sculpt the land to truly make your farm your own 
    Grow crops and raise animals 
    Fall in love, and get married with 3 bachelors/bachelorettes each to choose from 
    Save the Harvest Goddess and restore the land, one crop at a time

		<desc>Long ago the towns of Bluebell and Konohana were friendly neighbors, joined together by a tunnel underneath the mountain that separates the towns. Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where their cooking conflict continues four times per season.  
 
As a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor's story, hear about each town, and then decide where you want to start your new farm life.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask</name>
		<desc>Professor Layton and Luke head to the town of miracles, Montdol, in search of the Mask of Miracle. The mask has the ability to grant wishes to its wearer. Layton and Luke arrive at the town to see they are too late, as a mysterious man is using the power of the mask to turn people to stone. Layton and Luke task themselves with solving the mystery of Montdol and the Mask of Miracles. 
 
This fifth game in the Professor Layton series makes more use of the physical button controls for puzzle-solving as opposed to just the touchscreen. To take advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, the characters are rendered in polygons outside of cutscenes, as opposed to sprites, in addition to other polishings of the interface. 
 
Beside the regular adventure where you traverse the town, talk to the characters and solve puzzles, there are several mini-games that get gradually unlocked as you play and find the unlockable items: 
 
 Bunny - after a while, you will stumble upon a circus bunny that isn't performing well and decide to help it along. This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them. After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the moves necessary to perform the full play. 
 Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will become gradually available. Levels are rectangular in shape and you can move your robot left, right, up or down through the field of squares. Each movement uses some of the battery and you have to reach the end square before the battery depletes which still gives you a lot of time for trial and error. Single movement will move your robot by three steps unless it bumps into a wall or picks up some special items that may temporarily boost its power to eat through the wall and enemies that move in pre-defined patterns. 
 Shop - helping the friend in need, as a true gentleman, this mini-game will let you order the items in the store so that when customer comes to buy what he or she wants, the rest of the items also catch his/her eye and in turn you end up selling all your wares. Base item is initially set in the store, and you can place other items only adjacent to already placed items in the store. What will catch the eye of the customer after purchasing some item is the adjacent item that is either of the same type or of the same color. Placing two similar items might confuse the customer due to ambiguity which may lead the customer to stop buying after a while if the net remaining adjacent item has no connection to the last item he or she purchased. 
 
Beside mini-games there are many collectible items you can find during your exploration and some of the flashback sub-stories become available after certain key events which can then be watched as short episodes where characters vary from event to event, and might not even be one of the leading three characters.</desc>

Luigi, while checking his mail, found out he won a mansion in a contest.  What's weird, is he never entered any contest to begin with.  Being the curious person he is, he calls up his brother, Mario, and asks to meet him at the house. 
 
Luigi sets forth through a dark and scary jungle to find the house, but sees that Mario is nowhere to be found.  Puzzled, Luigi enters the mansion, only to encounter ghosts.  He meets up with a scientist, Professor E. Gadd, who explains the situation and hands over the Poltergust 3000.  Luigi must now make his way through the mansion's many rooms, sucking up as many ghosts as he can. 
 
As you explore, you must solve mysteries, collect cash/gems/jewels/coins, and encounter boss characters.  Luigi's vacuum has the ability to suck up ghosts that have inhabited this strange mansion.  However, the ghosts will not give up so easily.  You must struggle with them and pull them back to catch your prey with your trusty vacuum.  As you continue to your goal, you must face off with the deceased denizens of the house and the boos that haunt it, and unlock new rooms with the keys you find along the way.  You can also gain special abilities for your vacuum, such as the ability to shoot fire, water, or ice.  Remember though, treasure is scattered everywhere.  Check all the objects for coins and paper money, and who knows, you may just make enough money for Luigi to buy a mansion of his own... 
 
As you explore the strange mansion, the plot slowly unravels and it becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on in that haunted house.  Will you ever see your lost brother Mario again? </desc>

		<name>Pokemon Omega Ruby</name>
		<desc>In this enhanced remake of Pokémon Ruby Version, players travel throughout the Hoenn region on a journey to become a Pokémon Master. Like the original, the goal is to challenge the eight Pokémon Gyms of the Hoenn League and earn badges from their Gym Leaders, then take on the Elite Four and the Champion. However, the world is endangered when the villainous Team Magma tries to expand the continents by resurrecting the ancient Legendary Pokémon Groudon. 
 
Aside from technical upgrades, the game is drastically changed in certain aspects. The Hoenn Pokédex is changed to add the evolutionary relatives of Pokémon from its original incarnation. Some Pokédex entries are also changed. Mega Evolution plays a major part of the storyline, and a new form change is introduced in the form of Primal Reversion, exclusive to Groudon and Kyogre. Some characters have had major redesigns in terms of appearance. Instead of roaming Hoenn after defeating the Champion as in the original, Latios automatically joins the player's party after summoning the player Southern Island. Latios can be used to soar through the skies of Hoenn, taking the player to locations known as Mirage Spots that cannot be reached otherwise. Pokémon Contests return under the name "Contest Spectacular" and have some new mechanics, while the basic format is largely the same. 
 
After the main story, a new chapter called the Delta Episode is unlocked, allowing the player to once again save Hoenn from disaster. Finally, the Battle Tower is replaced by the Battle Resort, which features tough Trainers as well as a replica of the Battle Maison from Pokémon X and Y.</desc>

		<name>Pokemon Sun</name>
		<desc>Pokémon Sun, along with Pokémon Moon, marks the start of the seventh generation of the Pokémon franchise. The game takes place in the Alola region, an archipelago whose culture, geography, and native wildlife are based on those of Hawaii. A number of Alola's native Pokémon have never been seen before, bringing the series' total number of Pokémon species to over 800. 
 
The story follows a customizable protagonist who has just moved to the region and received their first Pokémon. What differs from past installments is that instead of the usual challenge of defeating eight Gyms, Alola is host to the island challenge, in which trainers face seven trials that test many other skills in addition to battling prowess. Only after clearing the seven trials and defeating the four island Kahunas can a trainer be called a champion. As the player character embarks on their island challenge, they are joined by a local boy named Hau, another newcomer to Alola named Lillie, and the mysterious Pokémon Cosmog that is under Lillie's protection. The group is forced to deal with Team Skull, a group of thugs who commit petty crimes under the leadership of their ruthless boss; the Aether Foundation, a wildlife conservation group with connections to Cosmog; and dangerous, otherworldly creatures called the Ultra Beasts. 
 
As usual for a new pair of Pokémon games, Sun and Moon boast a number of new and improved features. HMs are now replaced by Ride Pokémon, which are unlocked over the course of the story and can be called upon at any time to provide transportation and clear obstacles. Hyper Training allows players to boost their Pokémon's individual values, hidden values that impact a Pokémon's potential for stat growth and are otherwise immutable. The new Battle Royal mode pits four trainers against each other in a free-for-all fight where the goal is to score the most KOs while trying not to let one's own Pokémon faint. A group of islands called Poké Pelago allow the player's Pokémon to play and collect items while they aren't in the active party, and each island can be upgraded to provide more and better rewards. Lastly, a location called the Festival Plaza acts as the multiplayer hub, and combines features from prior games' Join Avenue and PSS systems.</desc>

		<name>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon - Gates to Infinity</name>
		<desc>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity is the ninth game in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series and the first for the Nintendo 3DS. The player is a human who has a dream about a Munna being chased by a Hydreigon and calling for help. The human then wakes up in a strange world and discovers they have been turned into Pokémon, and starts plummeting down through the sky to the ground! When they wake up, they find another Pokémon leaning over them and asking if they are okay. After introductions, the player accompanies this Pokémon through a cave to a desolate plot of land, which the Pokémon purchases. The Pokémon tells the player their dream of creating a Pokémon Paradise, and asks the player to help them. The player agrees and they become partners. 
 
The game is similar to previous entries in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series, but there are several new features. The Pokémon the player transforms into can be chosen by the player. The choices are Snivy, Tepig, Oshawott, Pikachu, and Axew. The player's partner can also be chosen, the choices being whichever four of those same five Pokémon the player didn't become. The game is rendered entirely in 3D, and takes advantage the the Nintendo 3DS's built-in 3D capabilities. The game also utilizes the AR (Augmented Reality) features. By using the Ar feature on round objects, a portal called a Magnagate opens up. This means there is an unlimited amount of Mystery Dungeons that can be explored within the game. TMs (Technical Machines) can now be reused as much as the player wants, reflecting the change in their function in the main series Pokémon games. Moves now have ranks, and will progress toward the next rank each time it is used. Another new feature is mini-games, which are hosted by Beartic. Depending on how well the player did, they may receive different prizes from completing mini-games.</desc>

		<name>Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperors Treasure</name>
		<desc>Raphael, a normal boy by day, acts as the legendary art thief Phantom R by night. He is well-known for stealing precious paintings and returning them days later, never getting caught. His true motive can be traced back three years prior to the start of the game, where Raphael's father mysteriously disappeared and left him with a strange coin. Raphael found all of the paintings his father had stolen shortly afterward, replacing them with forgeries. As Phantom R, Raphael works to replace his father's forgeries with the original artworks, meanwhile hoping he will someday find his father again.  
 
At the start of the game, Raphael finds a lead in the form of a museum exhibit which is currently displaying a bracelet with the same symbol as that on his father's coin. As Phantom R publicly announces his intention to steal the bracelet, Raphael must deal with the unraveling of a mystery involving a hostile man who claims to be the historical Napoleon, a mysterious girl named Marie who seems to have some connection to him, and the whereabouts of his very own father that may put him in over his head. 
 
Rhythm Thief &amp; the Emperor's Treasure is a mix of adventure and rhythm, following the story of a Parisian mystery. The player can explore various landmarks of Paris during their search for clues in a point-and-click style reminiscent of Professor Layton. Advancing through the plot may involve solving puzzles or, more frequently, completing a mini-game where Raphael must move to the beat. These games may make use of either the stylus or the gyroscope feature of the 3DS; depending on how closely the player has followed the rhythm, a letter rank will be given. Coins can be found throughout the city and used to buy items for use in a mini-game. Optional mini-games may also be found throughout the city, holding references to other SEGA franchises.</desc>

Players form their parties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals using Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into the dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the dungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible loot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.</desc>

With gameplay, visuals, and controls this smooth and consistent, no Zelda adventure has ever been so action-packed.</desc>

		<name>The Legend Of Zelda Majoras Mask 3D</name>
		<desc>Following in the footsteps of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, Majora's Mask 3D is an enhanced remake of the Nintendo 64 game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. It keeps the same story as the original: while riding Epona through the Lost Woods in search of an invaluable lost friend, Link is ambushed by a Skull Kid and two fairies, who steal Epona and the Ocarina of Time. Upon catching up with them, Skull Kid turns Link into a Deku Scrub and flees, but one of the fairies, Tatl, is left behind and starts traveling with Link. Emerging in a new realm called Termina, Link is informed by the Happy Mask Salesman that Skull Kid has stolen a precious mask from him, the evil and powerful Majora's Mask. Link then learns that the moon is falling onto Termina's central city, Clock Town, and he only has three days to stop it. 
 
Aside from graphical upgrades, some story and quest related features are reordered, removed, or expanded, and a few new features are added, such as two Fishing Holes, one near Southern Swamp and another at Zora Cape. Boss fights are also altered, with new weak points added in the form of a large eye resembling those on Majora's Mask. Using the old strategies won't work this time. Saving is also different. Playing the Song of Time to return to the Dawn of the First Day no longer automatically saves the game. Instead, the game must be saved at Owl Statues, which no longer force the player to suspend gameplay, or Quill Statues, which can save the game, but can't be warped to.</desc>

There are a variety of things to do in this game, such as producing crops and raising livestock. Story of Seasons introduces new characters, including a tiny goddess and a tiny witch.</desc>

The video game's storyline takes place after the film's events, in which Wrect-It Ralph and Fix-It Felix Jr. discover a new Cy-Bug invasion and must save the video gaming world once again with their famed wrecking and repairing skills. 
 
The main gameplay consists of guiding Ralph and Felix through several platforming levels in 3 worlds (Fix-It Felix Jr., Sugar Rush and Hero's Duty) within Game Central (the game's main hub). Wreck-It Ralph's abilities include smashing wooden crates, a ground pound to defeat enemies and pushing and pulling several objects, while Fix-It Felix Jr.'s abilities include double-jumping, wall-jumping, throwing his prized hammer and even repairing broken objects. 
 
Scattered throughout the levels include coins (that add towards your score), Hero Medals and even Easter Eggs (which are stored in the Trophy Room, even unlocking bonus concept artwork from the film). Cutscenes in-between levels also include vocal dialogue for every character.

		<desc>The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike.  
 
As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Befriending new Yo-kai may not be so easy, though â€“ in many cases, you will need to battle with them and impress them during your battle. Each Yo-kai has its own unique skills and strengths and youâ€™ll use them to challenge the evil Yo-kai and help people in need of solving daily problems â€“ like an argument with a friend or forgetting something important â€“ which may be caused by mischievous Yo-kai hidden everywhere.</desc>

		<desc>Captain Olimar wakes up after crash landing his ship, and realizing that the fuel supply is empty. After wandering about, he comes across some Pikmin hidden around, and eventually some Sparklium seeds, which are what is used as fuel for the ship, and thus, needed for escaping. 
 
In Hey! Pikmin, a spinoff of the Pikmin series, the player controls Captain Olimar, in a 2.5D side-scroller with puzzle elements, instead of the traditional 3D real-time strategy that the series goes by. 
 
Pikmin are found in the wild, and Captain Olimar can call upon them with his whistle, and then issue several different commands, such as throw them onto platforms, so they can remove obstacles and collect items. Olimar is controlled with the D-pad, while Pikmin are controlled with the stylus. As such, the game relies heavily on the touchscreen. 
Each Pikmin type has different abilities ? for instance, blue Pikmin can swim, red Pikmin are resistant to fire, and yellow Pikmin are resistant to electricity. The player must then utilize different Pikmin to suit different situations. 
 
Captain Olimar has a set of green bars depicting his health, which are depleted by simply bumping into enemies, instead of just by enemy attacks, like in previous games.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King</name>
		<desc>The court jester Dhoulmagus of the kingdom of Trodain stole a powerful magical scepter sealed beneath the royal castle. Using the power of the scepter, Dhoulmagus destroyed the castle, placed a curse upon the kingdom and its people, and turned King Trode into a troll and the princess into a horse. A sole surviving castle guard journeys with the king, the princess, a reformed bandit named Yangus and a few other companions in search of the evil jester and a way to break the curse.  
 
Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat mechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each belonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and most Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly vast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map traveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera rotation and optional first-person view. Like in the previous Dragon Quest games, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be physically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within. 
 
In addition to experience points, the player receives skill points from battles, which can be manually allocated into a skill category of the player's choice. These categories include three different kinds of weapons, fisticuffs, and a discipline unique to each character. After a required amount of skill points has been invested into a particular category, the correspondent character learns a new ability or becomes more proficient with the chosen weapon. The Alchemy Pot system allows players to gather recipes and mix items to create new ones. 
 
The international version of the game features several updates to the original Japanese version, including voice acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks, and flashier effects.</desc>

		<path>./Code of Princess (Usa).3ds</path>
		<name>Code of Princess</name>
		<desc>Code of Princess is a side-scrolling hack-n-slash RPG from the director of Guardian Heroes.  As Tetsuhiko Kikuchi's influence is heavy here, the game is, in some ways, like a spiritual successor to the aforementioned Saturn title. 
 
Code of Princess follows a typically "anime" plot about a princess whose kingdom is being overrun by monsters, and a motley crew of characters that meet and join together to overthrow the evil monsters and the reason the monsters are there.  Primary focus is on the character Solange as she wields a massive sword known as the deLuxcalibur, which is a sacred artifact of sorts for her kingdom.  She is joined by several other characters, most of whom are playable in the story mode of the game. 
 
Each stage is a fairly straight-forward side-scrolling affair more focused on intense combat than any amount of exploration. Each character uses the same basic controls, but all are played very differently.  Many combat moves are performed in a style similar to a fighting game, such as pressing down, towards, and the A or B button.  Players may typically move between 2-4 planes of action on the stage moving forward or back in the 3D space, and doing so is often part of the strategy of moving through levels.  Typically, a note at the top of the screen will give the current objective for the level or individual wave during the level, such as "defeat all enemies," "defeat the boss" (which makes the other enemies more of a distraction), "save a villager," or even simply to survive for a set period of time.   
 
Since levels and missions tend not be be very long they are very numerous and players will find themselves leveling up frequently.  Each level allows the player to assign skill points (generally 5 points) to any of six attributes:  Vitality (life), Piety (maximum magic), Attack, Defense, Mind (magic strength), and Speed.  Various status effects may affect the player throughout the game as well including burning, shock, stone, dark (draining magic), or poison.   
 
Each main story character not only plays differently, but they level up independently of one another, so that players may choose customize each character differently.  For instance, Solange is naturally a bit slow, but fairly powerful, so a player may build on these strengths adding new speed and ramping up her strength even more.  The character Ali is already pretty fast, so players may want to customize based on that, while other characters are more magic-based, or various combinations of strength, magic, speed, etc. 
 
Besides the regular story missions, there is a Free Play mode that allows players to replay any story mission without lengthy cut scenes or dialog, and there are Bonus missions which unlock parallel to the Story.  Often, they operate as elements to deepen the overall story experience through the gameplay, or simply to add new twists that aren't part of the main story, such as fighting a boss a second time after the boss has, essentially received a "second wind" and called in some support.  Bonus Missions also tend to be more challenging, with many of them greatly exceeding the difficulty of the regular story missions, leaving these to be "pro" challenges or challenges for those players willing to replay missions enough to level up several times more. 
 
During combat, players may lock-on to a single enemy, which allows the player to deal heavier damage to said enemy.  On top of this, activating a Burst gradually drains the magic meter, but also increases all attacks on every enemy.  Combining this with a lock-on allows a player to deal massive damage with every attack.  There is also a shop where players may buy better weapons, armor, and the like--though it is fairly small compared to a traditional RPG. 
 
Finally, the game also uses the Nintendo Network for local and online co-op and versus play, complete with leaderboards.  This mode also allows players to use more than just the main eight main protagonist characters--practically every single enemy character in the game can be unlocked to be used in this mode, from the simplest soldier characters to massive dragons and even boss characters.  </desc>

		<name>LEGO Ninjago: Shadow of Ronin</name>
		<desc>LEGO Ninjago: Shadow of Ronin is the most advanced video game based on LEGO Ninjago franchise, using engine known from LEGO Jurassic World. The story involves the adventures, characters and locations  introduced in the first five seasons of the series. Sensei Wu Crew meets a new threat: Ronin, who erased the ninjas memories with obsidian glave and is seeking for the primal folcrum to bring back Chen from the cursed realm. In order to restore their memories, ninjas have to find elemental obsidian weapons and then stop Ronin from fulfilling his quest. 
 
The game is expanding with each progress, allowing to open new locations, characters and bonus content. Each level is played with a certain adjusted group of characters. Some of the environment based puzzles require switching between characters to use specific abilities or elementals. Unlocked locations appear on the Ninjago tactical map. Reaching the specific location requires traveling on a dragon. The action includes fighting, climbing up walls and chains, jumping, interacting with technology panels, destroying and assembling new objects out of the bricks objects, using bikes, sliders, jets, robots, dragons and much more.  
 
There are 113 playable characters to unlock, each with specific abilities. Unlocking the character requires reaching a specific place or fulfilling a quest and buying him in the store with a gathered sum of bricks. The game features 10 extras, 34 achievements and 10 unique locations, well known from the cartoon series.

		<path>./Kokuga (USA).3ds</path>
		<name>Kokuga</name>
		<desc>Kokuga is a slow-moving, free-scrolling top-down shooter where players are placed in control of a futuristic "compact mobile tank" known as Kokuga.  The Kokuga is suspended on four "legs" and features a single turret capable of rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.   
 
Each stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like, turret-like, and robotic enemies.  Most stages end with massive and varied boss battles.  Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus shield repairs.  Destroying the gate without defeating all the enemies in that section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.   
 
Kokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways.  Rather than collecting power-ups, players already have 20 "cards" to utilize.  Of these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on the touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser ring around the player, to homing shots, to shield restoration and damage repairs.  Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to get new ones, at least one current card must be used.  In this way, the game offers an unusual strategy element to the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up cards over simply powering up as much as possible as soon as possible. 
 
Also different is the level set-up.  There are three "final" stages at the corners of a triangular grid which make up the final stages.  The stages themselves are laid out somewhat like a keyboard labeled with letters A~L, and a player may start at any stage.  However, continuing through the game requires a player to select an adjacent stage from the completed first.  
 
A final "game ending" stage can only be played once an adjacent stage has been completed. In this way, players may play for as long or as short as they wish.  With games encompassing several stages, or just a couple.  This longer game option even allows players to replay a completed stage--but it will automatically be at a higher difficulty.  In this way, a player's game could be as short as two stages (a regular and a final) or as long as 37 (all regular three times, and one final). 
 
In a vain similar to the dark, nigh-genocidal story behind titles like Ikaruga, the story here is a bleak melodrama focused on ethnic rivalries and the incomprehensible nature of humans.  The similarity is likely due to the game sharing the same director (Hiroshi Iuchi) as Ikaruga.  No actual countries are named, rather, they are listed by letters with "Country A" and "Country I."  The story is played out in largely text-based cut-scenes with dark background imagery.  The text itself carries a militaristic flavor to it, further adding to the melodrama of the story.</desc>

Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is the fourth game in the Ace Attorney series, and the first to be designed from the ground up for the Nintendo DS.  In addition to the now-familiar courtroom action and investigation, Apollo also gets to take part in forensic investigation, such as taking plaster casts and dusting for prints.  Players can also examine their inventory in three dimensions, as clues can sometimes be hidden out of normal sight. 
 
Apollo also has a special talent - the ability to perceive people's nervous habits.  If a witness' testimony appears to be rock solid, Apollo can still crack it by taking note of their nervous habit that they perform whenever they're lying, and catch them in the act by shouting out "GOTCHA!".</desc>

		<name>Fire Emblem Fates - Birthright</name>
		<desc>A youth has grown up as one of the royal children of the glory-seeking nation of Nohr. Though their father has forbidden them to leave the castle, they still live a happy life with their four siblings. However, when they finally are sent to the outside world, it is on a mission to Hoshido, a peace-loving country that Nohr has plans to invade. There they learn that they were born to the Hoshido royal family, and were kidnapped by Nohr as an infant. A Nohr princess named Azura was taken hostage by Hoshido in retaliation, and has been living in a similar situation to the protagonist. With war looming on the horizon, Azura and the protagonist choose to side with their family in Hoshido, and defend it against the invading Nohr forces. 
 
Birthright is one of three versions of Fire Emblem Fates, the others being Conquest and Revelation. In this version, the player controls their fully customizable avatar as they lead Hoshido's forces in strategic battles against Nohr-allied enemies. Gameplay is similar to Fire Emblem Awakening, with less challenging gameplay and the opportunity to grind for money, items, and experience in between storyline battles. In addition to the Classic and Casual modes featured in Awakening, this game contains Phoenix Mode, in which defeated allies are immediately resurrected on the following turn. Players pick one of these three modes at the start of the game, but may choose to permanently switch from Classic or Casual to a less difficult mode later on. 
 
Supports also return from Awakening, allowing characters to build their relationships as they fight alongside each other. Two characters of the opposite sex may get married and have children once their relationship has progressed enough, and Birthright also includes the possibility of a same-sex relationship if the player chooses the female protagonist. 
 
A feature called My Castle allows the player to build and customize a village that can contain various helpful buildings, such as shops that sell weapons or healing items. The village can be upgraded with resources collected through StreetPass, and it is also where StreetPass battles are held. Winning a StreetPass battle allows the player to recruit one of the defeated opponent units into their own army, and a shop in the village allows players to purchase other special units called Einherjard. 
 
Players may purchase DLC that allows them to play through the Conquest and Revelation scenarios as well.</desc>

		<name>Pokemon Rumble World</name>
		<desc>Control cute Toy Pokemon and have exhilarating battles in Pokemon Rumble World! This downloadable game for systems in the Nintendo 3DS family is packed with Pokemon that you can battle and befriend. You can collect 719 species of Pokemon: all the ones that have appeared in the video games up through Pokemon Omega Ruby and Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. When you defeat one of the wild Pokemon you meet in a stage, it sometimes becomes your friend. Even Mega-Evolving Pokemon will join the battles, a first for a game in the Pokemon Rumble series! 
 
 
 
Befriend as many Pokemon as you can: as you collect more species of Pokemon, your Adventurer Rank goes up. As your Adventurer Rank goes up, the shop will offer more products, and stages will feature stronger Pokemon. 
 
 
 
It's not just Pokemon that will appear in Pokemon Rumble World. Your Mii character will also appear in your game, as well as the Mii characters of players you pass! It's the first time in the Pokemon Rumble series that Mii characters have joined in to interact with Pokemon and have adventures together. 
 
 
 
Your story is set in the kingdom of toys, and the adventure starts when the king summons you. He explains his frustration at having only one Pikachu. In contrast, a mysterious magician has captured several Pokemon! So the king asks you to show that magician a thing or two by collecting lots more Pokemon, and he lends you his Pikachu to get you started on your adventures. Depart from the castle town via a hot-air balloon to get to different areas where wild Toy Pokemon await! 
 
 
 
It's fun to connect with other friends playing Pokemon Rumble World. Players can visit your castle town via StreetPass. Connect your Nintendo 3DS system to the Internet, and Mii characters of faraway players will visit you. They can even provide support for you in future battles in a variety of ways. 
 
 
 
Poke Diamonds are meant to make your adventures even more exciting and easy. With Poke Diamonds, you can get hot-air balloons, clothes for your Mii character, extras that provide more fun in your game play, and more. In addition, Poke Diamonds can be used to continue playing in a stage after your Pokemon's HP runs out, as well as to re-inflate hot-air balloons that have become deflated after use. You can acquire them in various ways, including at the beginning of the adventure and when you speak to Mii characters who come to the castle town via StreetPass. You can also purchase Poke Diamonds at the shop in the castle town via Nintendo eShop.</desc>

		<desc>Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a social simulation game. The player takes on the role as the new mayor in a small village populated by animals. Gameplay consists of improving the village with new buildings and decorations, collecting furniture and items for one's house, and donating fossils, fish, insects and art to the local museum. 
 
Several features in the game make their series debut here, while others have been brought back from older Animal Crossing games after having not been seen in the DS or Wii entries. These include public works projects, which allow new landmarks and buildings to be added to the town, as well as altering the appearance of certain major buildings; the Dream Suite, which allows players to visit other towns in a single-player session; a tropical island that hosts minigames and multiplayer interactions; Re-Tail, a store that acts as a flea market and allows the player to customize certain furniture items with alternate color schemes or patterns; and QR code sharing for player-made clothing and patterns. 
 
A free update, titled Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, was released in late 2016. This patch added amiibo functionality, including 64 villagers only available through the use of a corresponding card or figure. 50 of these are villagers who had previously only appeared in the GameCube and/or Nintendo 64 installments of the series; the other 14 are tie-in villagers that represent characters from The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, Monster Hunter, and Hello Kitty. Other features include new items and currency, an RV campground near the outskirts of town, minigames and features from Animal Crossing spin-off titles, and several miscellaneous features intended for the player's convenience.</desc>

		<desc>Embark on an adventure through the depths of the dungeon as a couple in Picdun 2: Witch's Curse, the 3D dungeon RPG.

Picdun is back, now better than ever! And this time, you can explore as a couple!

Picdun 2: Witch's Curse is a 3D dungeon RPG set in the mysterious dungeon called "Picdun." Choose your partner from three female adventurers--the Archer, the Whipper and the Spellcaster--and venture into the depths of the dungeon together. Sixty stages await you, filled with a wide variety of puzzles ranging from easy to mind-bendingly difficult!

Places you go are mapped automatically, and once you cover all the tiles on a floor you will complete the picture hidden underneath.

As in the previous game, battles feature a large number of dynamic and powerful enemies. The hero is unable to attack due to the Witch's Curse, so he must protect his partner with a shield and guide her to attack by chopping down or slashing sideways. Also, you can trigger a power move by raising the shield at the same time as an enemy attack.

Explore the depths of the dungeon to uncover the mystery of the Witch's Curse!</desc>

		<name>Super Mario 3D Land</name>
		<desc>Super Mario 3D Land is a platform game that has been described by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a "3D Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game." As such, Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side-scrolling Mario titles, such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world Mario titles, such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions. Similar to the classic side-scrolling Mario games, the objective of each level is to reach and grab the "Goal Pole" located at the end of the course before the time limit expires. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar health system to those games, in which Mario shrinks upon taking damage from enemies or hazards, and damage while as "Small Mario" results in losing a life.</desc>

		<name>Metroid : Samus Returns</name>
		<desc>Metroid: Samus Returns is a side-scrolling action-adventure video game developed collaboratively by MercurySteam and Nintendo, with the latter also publishing it for the Nintendo 3DS handheld game console. A part of the science fiction Metroid series, the game is a reimagining of the 1991 Game Boy game Metroid II: Return of Samus, and was released worldwide on 15 September 2017. It follows series protagonist Samus Aran, who is sent by the Galactic Federation to exterminate the parasitic Metroids on their home planet of SR388. 
The game features a story and structure similar to Metroid II but with new controls, visuals, and gameplay. It also introduces some features that are new to the 2D Metroid games, such as melee counterattacks, an ability to fire freely at any angle, and a selection of different abilities. The development on Samus Returns began in 2015, with longtime Metroid developer Yoshio Sakamoto producing it. The game was met with positive reception from video game journalists, who praised its visuals and improved gameplay over the original game, with many viewing it as a return to form for the series.</desc>
